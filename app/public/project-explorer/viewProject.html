            <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
            <p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold
                these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
                I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of
                former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
                I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
                injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and
                justice.</p>
